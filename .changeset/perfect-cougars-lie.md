Add anonymous telemetry to Wrangler commands

For new users, Cloudflare will collect anonymous usage telemetry to guide and improve Wrangler's development. If you have already opted out of Wrangler's existing telemetry, this setting will still be respected.

See our [data policy](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler/telemetry.md) for more details on what we collect and how to opt out if you wish.
